## üöÄ Recommended workflow

   ### 1. Login ‚≠ê

     "Read /docs/Ai-Assistant/project-context.md to understand the project"

   Result: I have a complete context in 30 seconds without long explanations.

   ### 2. Check Status Current

     "Check /docs/ai-assistant/current-state.md and /docs/todo/current-tasks.md-What should you do now?"

   Result: I give you clear priorities based on the current state.

   ### 3. Directed Development

   #### for specific tasks:

     "I want to add tooltips to gui parameters - show me how"
     "I need to create a new count number 10 - Help me"
     "The performance is slow - diagnosis and optimizes"

   #### for exploration:

     "Check the code and suggest 3 priority improvements"
     "What functions need comments urgently?"
     "Find possible bugs or performance problems"

   ### 4. Guided implementation

     "Implement [task] following the patterns in /docs/ai-assistant/code-patterns.md"

   Result: Code consisting of project conventions.

   ### 5. Testing and Validation

     "Compila, test and verify that all 0-9 presets work"
     "Run the Checklist of /docs/ai-Assistant/quick-commands.md"

   ### 6. Commit and documentation

     "Make Commit of the changes and update /docs/ai-assistant/current-state.md if necessary"

   ## üí° most useful specific commands

   ### üî• Frequent Commands

   #### Quick Start:

     "Context: Texttypoorganic02, Lee /docs/ai-Assistant/project-context.md and tell me the current state"

   #### Code analysis:

     "Check SRC/organictext.cpp and suggests improvements based on /docs/todo/current-tasks.md"

   #### Guided development:

     "Implement [function x] following the pattern of /docs/ai-assistant/code-patterns.md"

   #### Debugging:

     "The preset 3 does not work well - diagnosis using the Code -Patterns.md" debug patterns "

   #### Performance:

     "Analyze performance and suggest optimizations based on Current-State.MD"

   ### üéØ Commands by type of task

   #### New features:

     "I want to add [feature x] - show me the step step by step using quick -commands.md"

   #### Bug Fixing:

     "There is a problem with [x] - check Known -Bugs.md and give me solution"

   #### Refactoring:

     "Improve the function [x] keeping the patterns of code-patterns.md"

   #### Testing:

   ## üé® Creative and advanced commands

   ### Creative exploration:

     "Suggest 3 new interesting visual presets based on existing ones"
     "What new types of animation would be easy to implement?"

   ### Specific optimization:

     "The Connectiontenance is causing LAG - optimizes this function"
     "The trails consume a lot of memory - improves management"

   ### Development directed by objectives:

     "OBJECTIVE: Add FPS Counter. Plan, implement and testify our conventions"

   ## ‚ö° Tips for maximum efficiency

   ### do's ‚úÖ

     * Start by mentioning the relevant A-Assistant file
     * Be specific about which part of the code you are interested in
     * Reference Code-Patterns.md conventions when you ask for code
     * Ask Testing after important changes
     * Update documentation when you make significant changes

   ### Don'ts ‚ùå

     * Do not ask for project explanations (USA PROJECT-context.md)
     * Do not ignore the priorities of Current-State.MD
     * Do not break the established Naming conventions
     * Do not forget to test the presets after changes

   ## üîÑ Workflow full example

     User: "Context: TexttyPoorganic02. Lee Ai-Assistant/Current-state.md and tell me what task of high priority should do now"

     COPILOT: [LEE CURRENT-STATE.MD] "High priority: Add comments to samplestringpoints (). I show you the function and suggest comments ..."

     User: "Perfect, implement those comments following code-patterns.md"

     COPILOT: [Implement comments following conventions]

     User: "Compila and Testa that everything works"

     COPILOT: [COMPILA, TESTS PRESETS 0-9, report results]

     User: "Make Commit with appropriate message"

     COPILOT: [MAKES GIT COMMIT WITH DESCRIPTIVE MESSAGE]

     User: "Update Current-State.MD Marking this task as completed"

     COPILOT: [Update documentation]
